EDA , Hypothesis Testing and Scaling on Seoul Bike Data


As a part of a class assessment we performed the following on a dataset called Seoul Bike Data in which we predict the number of bikes that will be 
rented in a particular hour of a particular day, depending on variables such as different weather conditions and if that particular day was a holiday or not etc :

1) Descriptive Statistics on different variables on the dataset
2) Several Visualisations to study the relationships among the variables
3) Correlation and Covariance Analyis using Heatmaps and Scatterplot
4) Hypothesis Testing to study the relationship among different variables
5) Finally, Scaled the numerical variables using Standard Scaling, MinMax Scaling and Robust Scaling and encoded the categorical variables

The goal of this whole process is get the data ready to train the model
